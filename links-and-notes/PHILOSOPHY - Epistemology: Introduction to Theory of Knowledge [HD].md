This particular will focus on some basic features of knowledge, features that any good theory of it, should try to explain.

What kind of things can you know?

The english word know is used in several ways.

You can know a person, a place, a language.

But the most common way of using the verb "to know", is the way we use it when we are speaking of someone knowing a fact, as in Alice knowing it's raining outside.

In this series, we'll be focusing on this knowing a fact sense of the verb "to know".

Sometimes this is called "knowledge-that". Actually along with "-that", you can use question words like "-where", "-when"

Knowing "where the party is" means knowing the answer to the question "where's the party?". And that's going to be a fact. Like the fact that the party is at Alice's place. Knowledge is a way of being latched onto a fact.

It is thought that every language in the world has a word to translate this fact-grabbing sense of the word "to-know".

And this kind of global popularity is very rare, only about a hundred words are thought to be universal in this way. Around the world, verbs meaning "to-know" are also very heavily used. It's one of the top ten most commonly used words in english for example.

So we often find ourselves talking about knowledge, but when we say someone know something, what do we mean?

It can help to compare knowing and just believing.

Consider these two sentences:

1. Alice knows it's raining outside

2. Pierre believes that it's raining outside.

We instinctively feel some difference between Alice and Pierre, but what is it?

Actually, we'll see there's several points of contrast here.

- The first and easiest has to do with truth. If Pierres that it's raining outside where he is, maybe he is wrong. Maybe the rain has stopped. Maybe he is fooled by the sound of water dripping from the trees.

    The things we believe are sometimes true and sometimes false. What we actually know on the other hand has to be true or factual.

    So there's no problem saying, "Pierre believes it's raining, but it isn't". While it sound weired to say "Alice knows it's raining, but it isn't."

    This is because attachment to the truth is built into the meaning of knows-that.

- Beyond truth, another key feature of knowledge is confidence.

    Let's suppose that Pierre is in a windowless room, and he's been there for an hour. He could suspect that it's still raining outside, even if he's not totally sure.

    But if Alice knows that it's raining, she has no doubt. She's confident.

-  So is confident belief in a truth enough for knowing? Apparently not. There's at least one more thing we need.

    Imagine that Pierre is really pessimistic, he's always strongly convinced that things will go badly. He's often wrong, but sometimes he is right. 
    
    Today he wakes up in a windowless room. Aware Alice has planned a picnic, because forecast was for sunny weather. 

    "It's going to be terrible". he thinks, "I'm sure it's already raining right now." He is entirely confident that it's raining. Although he can't actually see or hear the rain.

    Let's say by chance it turns out he's right this time. Does Pierre actually know? If he doesn't know, it seems knowledge requires something more than confident belief in a truth.

Feeling pessimistic isn't a good judgement about the weather. Your judgement needs to have a good basis in order to count as knowledge.

What kind of basis counts as good? Do you have to standing outside getting wet? This is a controversial question.

[5:33](https://youtu.be/r_Y3utIeTPg?t=333)

Is knowledge even possible for us?

Even in the best case scenario, when it feels like you are standing right outside, right in the rain, can you really know it's raining outside? Cound you be dreaming for example, on a clear night?

This is the problem of skepticism.
