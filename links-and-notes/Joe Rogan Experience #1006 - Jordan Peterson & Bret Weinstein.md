Joe: 

> Who's idea was it to do this? first of all.

Bret: 

>I saw somebody tweeted a clip of your(Jordan) perspective on Hitler and your arguement was he was actually even far worse than his reputation would lead us to believe and it's funny it harkens back to my first evolutionary project as an undergraduate I was working with Bob Trevors. 

>I did a project with Bob on analyzing the holocaust from an evolutionary perspective I wanted to test the question about whether you know at the time it was common place for people to say that Hitler was crazy and there was something that bothered me about that analysis. 

> I think there's something actually dangerous that we dismiss somebody like Hitler as crazy before we understand what actually they're up to so when I saw your video clip I thought it would be worth having a discussion so that we could figure out what perspective makes sense.

Joe:

> That sounds like an awsomne topic but before we get to that. I would like to know what's going on with you. Because you are at the center of this crazy controversy of Evergreen State College.

Jordan:

> You know they're educated to do that to some degree, because one of the tenants of the post-modernism that they are being spoon-fed is that there's nothing but power. That's the only thing that mediates relationships between people, cause there's no real world. Everthing is a social construct, and it's a landscape of conflict between groups. That's the postmodern world.

> The only actual means of expression is power. That's why the postmodernist make the claim constantly that the patriarchy is a corrupt institution because they look at hierarchical organizations and they're stratified obviously there's people at the top and people at the bottom. The only reason there's people at the top is because they dominate by power there's no philosophy of authority or competence. That's all gone. And so if you're cynical about that sort of thing and you should be. You might say part of the reason that the only thing that the postmodernists believe is power is because that helps them to justify their arbitrary use of it under any circumstances whatsoever and I think that' right. I think that's exactly what happens. So it's not surprising that you see this manifested in mob-like behavior of the students. It's right in accordance with everything they're being taught.

Joe:

> Well, they are also being taught and this sort of any means necessary to get over the establishment like the establishment is this horrible institution and they could justify pretty much anything.

Jordan:

> I think we've already figured out everyone from the right to the left. Everyone's figured out wherever the NAZIs went that was wrong. We all agreed on that. We're not going there anymore and so when someone pops up and says we should go there. It's like their immediately identifiable, you can box them in and if you have any sense like you know like many conservatives did. In the aftermath of the Charlottesville they come out and say "In case it needs to be said again, we're actually not allied with those people."

Joe:

> Yeah. That's one of the most disturbing things for many people about Donauld Trump's reaction to it. That he didn't take a hard stance against these white supremacists, showing up with tiki torches, walking to the street, yelling anti-semitic phrases. Whatever. It was a horrific thing to watch. Donald Trump comes out and says "There was horrible hehavior on all sides."

Jordan:

> I thought about that for a lot, because I got tangled up with that in stange way in Canada. I was supposed to appear on panel, a panel discussing the suppression of free speech on university campuses, which was then promptly canceled by the university that was going to host it, in the aftermath of Charlottesville. Partly because one of the panelist was going to be faith goldie who was the journalist that was covering Charlottesville and got the footage of the car and the damage. We were targeted immediately afterward with the NAZI epithet and Ryerson shutdown the free speech panel.

Joe:

> How you were targeted? You were targeted as NAZIs?

Jordan:

> What happened was this this person put up a facebook page and used a swastika with a no with a cirle and a line through it. And said "No facists at Ryerson" essentially. But she used the swastika and she got a bunch of people rallied together to pressure the university administration into cancelling the event which they promptly did. And then they had a celebration party the night of the event. They got a couple of hundred of people out to the celebration at Ryerson. And they were united under the banner of Hammer and Sickle. And were calling for revolution. And what was so interesting about that and I really mean technically that was interesting was that the mainstream media said virtually nothing about the fact that these, let's call them counter-protesters. I don't know exactly how you'd term them, had come out under this muderous symbol. And that's made me think, I can't figure out why the swastika is an immediate identifier of a pathological personality and the hammer-and-sickle isn't. There's actually a reason, it isn't just arbitrary and I think maybe it's something like the NAZI is the guy who knives you in the ally and steals your wallet and the communist is the white-collar criminal who takes your pension and you're more afraid of the first person than the second person, because the damage they do is more proximal and immediate and emotionally recognizable, but that's the second guy who takes your pension for example he's perhaps even more dangerous, but there's a bloodiness about the NAZI symbol and the immediate emotional impact that the hammer-and-sickle just doesn't produce. And some of that is because people are badly educated historically.

Joe:

> I think that's it.

[9:01](https://youtu.be/6G59zsjM2UI?t=541)

Jordan:

> I don't think that's just ignorance.

Joe:

> Do you think people wearing those Che Guevara T-shirts really understand the history of Che Guevara or you think he represents this sexy South American counter-protest character, a guy who stands up to the establishment as we know it. A guy wa wearing a green beret hiding in the jungle fighting against the oppressive dictatorship of America. I mean that's what they're looking at when they see that image.

Jordan:

> Well, the fact that historical ignorance plays a role in this is absolutely certain and I think the romanticization of people Che Guevara. I think you nail that exactly. But I do think there's a deeper question here. I was thinking in the aftermath of Charlottesville, many conservatives immediately divorced themselves from the NAZIs. Ben Shapiro was a good example. It was very much reminiscent of William F Buckley divorcing himself from the John Birch society back in the 1960s. The right-wing. It seems to be easier for the right-wing to draw a ling around the NAZIs and say no that's not us. Partly because the right-wingers conservatives are better at drawing boundaries, but you know let's say we wanna to draw a boundary around the radical leftists. Okey, point to something. Well on the right you say well you wore a swastika. Yeah you're out of the club man.

Joe:

> Right

Jordan:

> On the left, well you believe, what's the smoking pistol. You believe in equity? That's a smoking pistol as far as I'm concerned. But it doesn't have the same emotional punch as you wore a swastika to the protest.

Bret: 

> You believe in equity and you refuse to define it. That would be the indicator to me.

Jordan:

> Right! But that's such a. There's no emotional punch in that. Like I'm not going to associate with you because you believe in equity.


Bret:

> It's too complicated.

Jordan:

> That's right.


[10:38](https://youtu.be/6G59zsjM2UI?t=638)

Bret:

> It's too complicated.

> I do wanna to back us up here though. Because, I think we underrate the danger of and I think NAZIs are a red herring. There is something that actually does threaten to re-emerge and Charlottesville is a version of it. But I think because we have a cartoon understanding of what that protest was actually about and how many people are actually involved. We don't really see why this is a dangerous and contentious issue and I think the answer is an evolutionary one that hasn't been spelled out and because it hasn't been spelled out. It's very hard to point to.

> So my point would be, what took place in Germany in the 30s was a particularly visible well-documented example of a pattern that is much more common in human history and because this pattern emerges as a result of certain features of the way evolution functions in the context of humans. It is actually always a danger that will re-emerge and knowing what to do about it is not so simple until you've seen why it occurs and what it means. What I've been saying in lectures I've given on this is that tyranny is the end game of prosperity. So there is a pattern in which you will go through a period of prosperousness in which it appears that that thing is defeated once and for all. There's no reason for people to going after each other in this particular way and then at the point that pattern peters out. It re-emerges. People don't expect it flies under a different flag or something like that.

> And so I do think that looking at the tiny number of people who were doing what they were doing in Charlottesville and saying well that's we all agree that this is wrong misses the fact that actually, I think Trump is doing it cynically, but Trump was riding a wave that there are ideas which are not permissible from the environments from which we all grew up that are going to become permissible again if we are not careful to recognize that that's the nature of history.
