Joe: 

> Who's idea was it to do this? first of all.

Bret: 

>I saw somebody tweeted a clip of your(Jordan) perspective on Hitler and your arguement was he was actually even far worse than his reputation would lead us to believe and it's funny it harkens back to my first evolutionary project as an undergraduate I was working with Bob Trevors. 

>I did a project with Bob on analyzing the holocaust from an evolutionary perspective I wanted to test the question about whether you know at the time it was common place for people to say that Hitler was crazy and there was something that bothered me about that analysis. 

> I think there's something actually dangerous that we dismiss somebody like Hitler as crazy before we understand what actually they're up to so when I saw your video clip I thought it would be worth having a discussion so that we could figure out what perspective makes sense.

Joe:

> That sounds like an awsomne topic but before we get to that. I would like to know what's going on with you. Because you are at the center of this crazy controversy of Evergreen State College.

Jordan:

> You know they're educated to do that to some degree, because one of the tenants of the post-modernism that they are being spoon-fed is that there's nothing but power. That's the only thing that mediates relationships between people, cause there's no real world. Everthing is a social construct, and it's a landscape of conflict between groups. That's the postmodern world.

> The only actual means of expression is power. That's why the postmodernist make the claim constantly that the patriarchy is a corrupt institution because they look at hierarchical organizations and they're stratified obviously there's people at the top and people at the bottom. The only reason there's people at the top is because they dominate by power there's no philosophy of authority or competence. That's all gone. And so if you're cynical about that sort of thing and you should be. You might say part of the reason that the only thing that the postmodernists believe is power is because that helps them to justify their arbitrary use of it under any circumstances whatsoever and I think that' right. I think that's exactly what happens. So it's not surprising that you see this manifested in mob-like behavior of the students. It's right in accordance with everything they're being taught.

Joe:

> Well, they are also being taught and this sort of any means necessary to get over the establishment like the establishment is this horrible institution and they could justify pretty much anything.

Jordan:

> I think we've already figured out everyone from the right to the left. Everyone's figured out wherever the NAZIs went that was wrong. We all agreed on that. We're not going there anymore and so when someone pops up and says we should go there. It's like their immediately identifiable, you can box them in and if you have any sense like you know like many conservatives did. In the aftermath of the Charlottesville they come out and say "In case it needs to be said again, we're actually not allied with those people."
